SETUP
1. Clone git repository
        git clone <git-repository url>
2. Set git configurations:
        git config --global user.name <username>
        git config --global user.email <email>

RULES
1. Do NOT add commits to the 'master' branch when
   working on a new feature! 
2. ALLWAYS work in a personal branch.
        git branch <personal_branch_name>
        git checkout <personal_branch_name>
        OR
        git checkout -b <personal_branch_name>
3. MERGING to the master branch is done ONLY by the
   Research Engineers, never by students.
4. To integrate your personal branch into the master
   branch create a 'pull request' on bitbucket.org and
   add AT LEAST ONE Research Engineer as a Reviewer.
