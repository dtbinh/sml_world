The SML World is a project started in January 2015 by João Pedro Alvito and Rui Oliveira, under the supervision of Pedro Lima and Jonas Mårtensson.

Until May 2015 the main focus of development of the SML World was directed towards the iQMatic demonstration at Scania.

After this demonstration the development started to shift towards platooning and cooperative driving solutions. From June to August the SML World team welcomed the contributions of four students from the ACCESS Summer Projects. Elin Karlsson and Johan Clemedson developed Platooning oriented controllers for the scaled trucks present at the SML, while Felix Abrahamsson and Magnus Arvidsson implemented perception and supervisory modules aiming to solve some of the challenges of the GCDC 2016 competition.
